# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)

## 1. Short Answer Questions

**Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?**

- **TensorFlow** (by Google) uses a static computation graph (with eager mode available), is widely adopted in industry, and offers strong deployment tools (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js). It is ideal for production-ready deployment and when using pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub.
- **PyTorch** (by Meta) uses a dynamic computation graph (imperative style), is popular in research, and is highly Pythonic and flexible for debugging and experimentation. It is preferred for fast prototyping and research workflows.
- **Choose TensorFlow** for production, mobile, or embedded deployment.
- **Choose PyTorch** for research, rapid prototyping, and when you want a more Pythonic experience.

---

**Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Interactively load, visualize, and transform datasets to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Prototyping and Model Experimentation:** Train and test multiple models with live outputs and visualizations (e.g., training curves, confusion matrices), supporting collaborative and reproducible development.

---

**Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?**

- spaCy provides pretrained pipelines for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and lemmatization, supporting over 60 languages.
- It is faster and more robust than basic string operations or regex, and can detect context-aware entities (like organizations or product names), tokenize grammatically, and handle multilingual text.
- Basic string operations cannot perform these advanced, context-aware, or language-specific tasks.

## 2. Comparative Analysis

**Compare Scikit-learn and TensorFlow:**

| Category         | Scikit-learn                        | TensorFlow                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Focus            | Classical ML (SVM, Trees, kNN, etc.)| Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)|
| Learning Types   | Supervised, unsupervised, basic ensemble | Neural networks, custom layers, RL  |
| Complexity       | Simple APIs, great for small datasets| Handles complex models, large data      |
| Beginner-friendly| Very accessible, low learning curve  | Slightly steeper learning curve         |
| Deployment Tools | None built-in                        | TensorFlow Lite, TF Serving             |
| Community + Docs | Mature with tons of tutorials        | Strong backing and rich ecosystem       |

- Use **Scikit-learn** for small-scale tasks like churn prediction or clustering.
- Use **TensorFlow** for image recognition, speech translation, and NLP.

# Part 3: Ethics & Optimization (10%)

- **Notebook:** [ethics_and_debugging.ipynb](Part%203%20-%20Ethics%20Optimization/ethics_and_debugging.ipynb)

## 1. Ethical Considerations

- **Amazon Reviews Model:**
  - Rule-based sentiment may fail with sarcasm or cultural nuance.
  - Reviews may overrepresent extreme opinions.
  - Language models may favor certain brands due to training data.
- **MNIST Model:**
  - MNIST is balanced by digit but lacks handwriting diversity.
  - No representation of various scripts or writing impairments.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or re-sample reviews by verified buyers.
  - Evaluate model performance across different sub-groups.

---

## 2. Troubleshooting Challenge

- **Buggy Code Issues:** Dimension mismatch and incorrect loss function.
- **Fix:**  
  - Use `categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class classification.
  - One-hot encode labels to match output shape.
  - After fixing, the model achieves high accuracy (e.g., 0.9706 on MNIST test set).
