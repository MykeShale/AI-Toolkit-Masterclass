## Objective & Guidelines

This assignment evaluates your understanding of **AI tools/frameworks** and their real-world applications through a mix of theoretical and practical tasks. You’ll demonstrate proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve problems.

- **Parts:**  
  1. **Theory:** Theoretical understanding of AI Tools  
  2. **Practical:** Implementation skills of AI tools  
  3. **Ethics & Optimization:** Ethical AI development and optimization skills

- **Group Work:** 3-5 members to enhance teamwork and AI engineering collaboration.

### Submission Guidelines
- **Code:** Well-commented scripts/Jupyter notebooks (to be submitted on GitHub)
- **Report:** PDF with:
  - Answers to theoretical questions
  - Screenshots of model outputs (e.g., accuracy graphs, NER results)
  - Ethical reflection  
  (Share PDF as an article in the Community, Peer Group Review, and include in GitHub Repo)
- **Presentation:** 3-minute video explaining your approach (all members participate; share on Community platform)

### Grading Rubric
