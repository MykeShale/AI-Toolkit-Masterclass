## 🔬 Part 2: Practical Implementation

### ✅ Task 1: Iris Classifier with Scikit-learn

- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree  
- **Dataset:** Iris Species (Kaggle)  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
- **Screenshots:** [Insert screenshots of confusion matrix or accuracy here]

### ✅ Task 2: CNN Digit Classifier with TensorFlow

- **Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits  
- **Architecture:** 2 Conv2D + MaxPooling → Dense Layers  
- **Accuracy:** >95%  
- **Visualization:** [Include training curves, sample predictions]

### ✅ Task 3: spaCy NER & Sentiment

- **Dataset:** Sample Amazon Reviews  
- **Features:** Named Entity Recognition (products, brands)  
- **Sentiment:** Rule-based logic (positive, negative, neutral)  
- **Output:** [Insert sample output screenshots or results]

## 🧭 Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

### Bias Analysis

- MNIST lacks handwriting diversity
- Amazon reviews may reflect polarity bias and cultural bias

### Fixing TensorFlow Bug

- **Issue:** Wrong loss function + input shape mismatch  
- **Fix:** Used `categorical_crossentropy` and one-hot encoded labels  
- [Insert code snippet or notebook link]
